# WriteFreely

A Swift package that wraps the [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org) API, for use in your Swift projects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See _Deployment_ for notes on how to add the library to your app.

### Prerequisites

You'll need Xcode 11.5 / Swift 5.2 installed along with the command line tools to work on this package.

Additionally, documentation is generated by [SwiftDoc](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swift-doc). After making any changes to the package's public API, you'll need to regenerate the docs; to do so, run the following commands in the terminal from the root directory of the package:

```bash
$ rm -rf .build/documentation
$ swift doc generate Sources --module-name WriteFreely
```

### Installing

1. Clone this repository.
2. There is no step two.

## Deployment

Follow the instructions in this [Apple Developer document](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) to add the `WriteFreely` Swift package to your app.

Once you've done that, just import the library into whichever files should consume it:

```swift
@import Foundation  // Or UIKit, Cocoa, &cet.
@import WriteFreely

// The rest of the Swift file goes here
```

Use public methods on the `WFClient` to send and receive data from the server. The methods leverage completion blocks and the `Result` type, so you'd call them like so:

```swift
func loginHandler(result: (Result<WFUser, Error>)) {
    do {
        let user = try result.get()
        print("Hello, \(user.username)!")
    } catch {
        print(error)
    }
}


guard let instanceURL = URL(string: "https://your.writefreely.host/") else { fatalError() }
let client = WFClient(for: instanceURL)
client.login(username: "username", password: "password", completion: loginHandler)
```
