A Swift package that wraps the [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org) API, for use in your Swift projects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes. See _Deployment_ for notes on how to add the library to your app.

### Prerequisites

You'll need Xcode 11.5 / Swift 5.2 installed along with the command line tools to work on this package.

Additionally, documentation is generated by [SwiftDoc](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swift-doc). After making any
changes to the package's public API, you'll need to regenerate the docs; to do so, run the following commands in the
terminal from the root directory of the package:

```bash
$ swift doc generate Sources --module-name WriteFreely --format html --output ./docs --base-url https://writefreely.github.io/writefreely-swift/
```

### Installing

1. Clone this repository.
2. There is no step two.

## Running the tests

Run the tests from the command line:

```bash
$ swift build
$ swift test
```

## Deployment

Follow the instructions in this [Apple Developer document](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) to add the `WriteFreely` Swift package to your app.

Once you've done that, just import the library into whichever files should consume it:

```swift
@import Foundation  // Or UIKit, Cocoa, &cet.
@import WriteFreely

// The rest of the Swift file goes here
```

Use public methods on the `WFClient` to send and receive data from the server. The methods leverage completion blocks
and the `Result` type, so you'd call them like so:

```swift
guard let instanceURL = URL(string: "https://your.writefreely.host/") else { fatalError() }
let client = WFClient(for: instanceURL)
client.login(username: "username", password: "password", completion: { result in
    switch(result) {
    case .success():
        // Do something with the returned WFUser
    case .failure():
        // Do something with the returned WFError
    }
})
```

See [the API documentation](https://developers.write.as/docs/api/?swift) for more details. Xcode-specific documentation
is also available [here](https://writefreely.github.io/writefreely-swift/).
